## Environment Setup  
if you haven't already, install mysql
```
$ npm install -- save mysql
```
and if you haven't already, create a host for your DB
after, you must export all the following:
```
$ export DB_USER='whatever the user is set through the hosting'
```
```
$ export DB_PASSWORD='whatever the password you set it to'
```
```
$ export DB_HOST='whatever the hosting is'
```
```
$ export DB_NAME = 'whatever the name is set too'
```
note that if you exit the terminal you MUST set up your DB environment again
```
$ npm install // install all your dependencies
```
```
$ webpack // install your webpack to obtain bundle.js file
```
```
$ npm start // Starts your server
```
In a seperate tab in the terminal
```
$ npm run bundle // this will rebundle every time a new change has occured
```
